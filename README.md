## book review

This book has opened my eyes to many, many new concepts in programming. Dependent types, programs-as-proofs, monad comprehensions, effects are all fairly intricate subjects and the book
explains them well. It make sure to cover what problems these ideas are solving, what the intuition behind them is and how they can work in practice. This is done very gently by taking a simple
program and continuously improving it with a newly introduced feature, which makes for a compelling learning experience.

I think not much functional programming experience is required since the book starts explaining the basics, but you will end up having
to learn these things before getting to the novel features. Because of its gentle approach, I came to understand some 'basic' function programming
notions more deeply than I did before. The state monad is such an example, on which the chapter in this book was sublime.

The book is not perfect though. I wish it went deeper into theorem proving. I think just a single chapter truly focused on this very special
and interesting use of the language, and none of the 'practical' chapters contained any proofs. This may just be because the focus of the book
is to create general purpose programs. The exercises also have room for improvement. There are generally few exercises, and they are almost trivial
compared to the examples treated in the main text. Many of the later chapters do not even have any examples at all. 

All in all, I consider this a great introductory text to dependent types, programs-as-proofs and functional programming in general. My mind has
been blown many times going through it. I just wish there was a sequel!
